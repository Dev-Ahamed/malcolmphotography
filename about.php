                <h2>Who Am I!</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Malcolm Lismore Photography! I'm Malcolm, a freelance photographer based on the stunning North West coast of Scotland. My passion lies in capturing the rugged beauty of Scottish landscapes, its diverse wildlife, and the mesmerizing coastal scenes. With over ten years of experience, I’ve developed a unique style that brings the natural world to life through my lens.</p>

                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>Growing up surrounded by Scotland’s dramatic scenery inspired my love for photography. My journey began with a simple camera gifted by my grandfather, and over the years, this hobby turned into a lifelong passion and profession.</p>

                <h2>What I Do</h2>
                <p>While my heart is in nature photography, I also specialize in weddings, portraits, and special events. Whether it's capturing the intimate moments of a wedding or the serene beauty of a landscape, I bring the same level of dedication and artistry to every project.</p>
